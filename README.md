This is my NFL W/L Prediction Dashboard

The Prediction Model:

-	Leveraging data science and statistical analysis, I delved into current team statistics, historical data, and various influencing factors. The outcome? A robust Win-Loss Prediction Model consistently provides accurate forecasts.

The Dashboard:

-	I’ve developed a dashboard and now host it on the Render platform. The dashboard allows you to explore my picks for the week, along with some other exciting features.

 -	(Note: I’m hosting on a budget, so it might take a minute or two to load. Thanks for your patience!)

💻 Technologies Used:

* Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, SciPy)
* Dash (Plotly) for Dashboard Creation
* Data Cleaning, Statistical Analysis, and Machine Learning for Predictive Modeling

📊 Results:

-	I have been very pleased with the results. My model is currently toe-to-toe with and even outperforming some of the most well-known models around.
